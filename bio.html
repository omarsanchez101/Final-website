he makes up on through hard work. He is from East Side San Jose and graduated from James Lick High School. He has taken AP multimedia art and ever since then, he became certain about what he wanted to do for a living. He then went on to continue his education at Evergreen Community College in which he was able obtain a certificate in arts along with his I.G.E.T.C requirements to transfer to San Jose State University. As of right now, he is a senior and planning to graduate spring 2022 with a bachelorâ€™s in studio practice and a minor in photography. His vision for the future is to continue creating and developing art by designing his own website to sell his artwork. With that being said, he hopes to start an art studio, where he can help new artists as himself to boost each other up. The studio will also be a place where he can start a teaching career. Where he can teach them the fundamentals of art and the work produced from the students can be displayed in the studio to help improve a community and art all around.
